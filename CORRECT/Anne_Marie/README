  HISTORY OF ORCA05 bathy in meters.
....................................

4-9 september 2003:
Interpolation of etopo2bedmap.nc (file from Elizabeth Remy, Mercator)
onto the ORCA05 grid. 
The opabat.F program reads the netcdf file  and produces files: 
- bathy_meter_guess_ORCA_R05.nc
- bathystats_guess_ORCA_R05.nc
put in the directory : 
/home1/porzig/treguier/PROJ/DRAKKAR/BATHY/OPABAT05/INTERP0


..................................
September 9th  2003: 
APPLYCOAST
Apply Gurvan's coast mask, taken from a 30 levels bathy. 
The result is : 
    bathy_meter_coast_ORCA_R05.nc
The mask is not as intended:  there  are areas where Gurvan wanted ocean 
and I have put land because the etopo2bedmap file had land.
I have probably modified the applycoast program afterwards, I have not kept the old version.

September 9th  2003:
EXTRA
batextra.f90 to remove ponds and spikes. 
I have noted that there was a bug (this treatment does not preserve the mask???) 
but in fact it looks more like the problem was in applycoast...
output file: bathy_meter_treated_ORCA_R05.nc

September 9th  2003:
IDL:
  do had modifications with the IDL program. 
The result is in the IDL directory (with a link):
 bathy_meter_treated_ORCA_R05_checked.nc

..................................
April 28 2004
Arne and Gurvan discover bug in mask; this causes some runoffs to fall on land in the arctic. 
I decide to correct it directly in the previous file, in order not to redo the other treatments. 
APPLYCOAST , program batcoast.f90
re-apply the mask, with input file: bathy_meter_treated_ORCA_R05_checked.nc
and ouput file: bathy_meter_treated_ORCA_R05_checked_coast_nobug.nc
 
unfortunately, this results in a hole in the Weddell sea where Gurvan's and my mask differ the most (points with bathy value =  99999).

VERIFICATION: 
in directory CORRECT, use the program verify.f90 with the log of the hand modifications 
(orca05_hand_modif_2003.h90) to verify that I have not undone the hand modifications. This seems OK. 

..................................
December 2006

in CORRECT directory, 
create a  new file orca05_hand_modif.h90. This is the previous log (orca05_hand_modif_2003.h90) with Ariane's modifs added (for the indonesian throughflow)
as well as new data to plug the hole in the Weddell Sea (taken from Gurvan's original 30 levels bathy). 

use the correct.f90 program.

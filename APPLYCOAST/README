Batcoast: 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
- program originaly written by Elisabeth Remy or Laure Siefridt from
     the package OPABAT; 

- adapted to netcdf format by Claude Talandier 
  and to bathymetry in meters only (partial steps) by A.M. Treguier

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This particular code is suitable for ORCA 0.25°:


INPUT files:
first try:   - coast_original_ORCA_R025.a: is an ascii file  provided by the MERCATOR team.
 - coast_ORCA_R025_drakkar.ascii: an edited file with a few grid points changed. 
    a few sea grid point removed from Asia; 
    one grid point at the tip of Cape St Vincent changed from land to ocean. 
                          

 - ../bathy_meter_guess_ORCA_R025.nc:   
                      bathymetry in "meters" obtained directly from the 
 		      interpolation of the etopo2bedmap.nc (MERCATOR POG team) file.
                      (first step, INTERP0). The initial file was bathystats.guess.median,
                      a FORTRAN sequential file provided by E. Remy. 
                      it has been converted into the file: bathy_meter_guess_ORCA_R025.nc
                      using the program bathystats_to_netcdf.f90 in 
                      /home1/porzig/treguier/PROJ/DRAKKAR/BATHY/OPABAT025

OUTPUT file:
 - bathy_meter_coast_ORCA_R025.nc

RESULT OF EXECUTION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 reading coast mask with format:1442i1
   Coast mask read ok, max =            1
   Coast mask read ok, min =            0
   The coastal mask has been applied. 
   553341  ocean points were put to 0
   128  points were land in first guess bathy but ocean in the mask
   0 new ocean points extrapolated from neighbors iter             1
   This is an ORCA R025 configuration, nperio=4
